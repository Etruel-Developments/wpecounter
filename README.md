Visits Post(types) counter. Shown the number of visits on lists of posts, pages and/or custom post types and shortcode.


== Description ==

Knows how much views has every post, page or custom post type, just on wordpress list. 
You can select on plugin settings, which types must count.  Also you can print using shortcode [WPeCounter] in widgets, post or pages. 

Works with Easy Digital Downloads Products to see how many views has every Download, also with other plugins that work with public custom post types.

Is extremely lightweight because it works with ajax.
