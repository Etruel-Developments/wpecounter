Track your content’s popularity with a fast, reliable post views counter. Smarter and lighter than other bloated plugins. 

== Description ==

**WP Views Counter** is a lightweight yet powerful plugin to track how many times each post, page, or custom post type is viewed — from inside the WordPress admin or via shortcode or block.

Designed for performance and precision, it's ideal for blogs, WooCommerce stores, or Easy Digital Downloads shops where knowing what content attracts the most attention is critical.

Unlike bloated analytics solutions, WP Views Counter focuses on just one thing — accurate view tracking — without slowing down your site.

= Why choose WP Views Counter over other counters? =

✅ **Accurate post view counts** shown in the admin list, shortcodes, or blocks
✅ **Metabox in each post** with manual reset option
✅ **Exclude views by user role** or logged-in users
✅ **Works with all post types** and EDD
✅ **Lightweight AJAX-based tracking** — no page reloads
✅ **Gutenberg block included** to display most viewed content
✅ **Import views from other plugins**
✅ **Multilingual and developer-friendly**

Track content performance at a glance and optimize your content strategy with a tool that just works — no tracking scripts, no third-party APIs, and no clutter.
